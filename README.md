# Description
This project contains a method which can solve problems in a way that is closer to human logic; to express this method, we want to examine a hypothetical system for automatic car braking to describe the mechanism of this method. This document consists of 5 parts which explains the problem and defines linguistic terms, then the fuzzy sets defined according to those linguistic terms; the third part rules were determined and the output membership value is determined. 


# Requirements 
This codes is built using Python 3.7.5, and utilizes the following packages : 
- Matplotlib 3.2.1
- NumPy 1.18.2
